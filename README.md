# Outsourcd - a Python Django API and React app for freelance workers to find jobs - GA Project Four
**This app has been deployed on Heroku here (https://outsourcd.herokuapp.com/)**
This is a full-stack application built with Django REST Framework and React, which I submitted as my final project for the General Assembly Software Engineering Immersive course.

The app enables users to register for an account as a freelancer, find and secure posted freelance jobs, and then manage progress in a dashboard. Users can complete specific tasks such as generating a PDF invoice for a particular job. Finally, users can add and modify their profile information in their managed profile area.

Brief & Timeframe:
------
* Build a full-stack application** by making backend and front-end
* Use a Python Django API using Django REST Framework to serve data from a PostgreSQL database
* Consume the API with a separate front-end built with React
* Be a complete product with multiple relationships and CRUD functionality
* Implement thoughtful user stories/wireframes
* Have a visually impressive design
* Be deployed and publicly accessible online
* Write DRY code and build RESTful APIs
Timeframe: 8 days
